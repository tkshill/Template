# TEMPLATE OSS REPOSITORY


## Description

This repo serves as an example for anyone wondering about the basic requirements necessary to set up an open source repository. The Issues, pull requests, supporting docs and [templates](https://github.com/tkshill/Template/tree/main/.github) are all meant to guides/resources for those wishing to create healthy spaces for contributions.
